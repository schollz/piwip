## piwip

play instruments while instruments play.

![screenshot]()

this script was inspired by the old-school auto-tuning where tapes were pitch shifted by varispeed tape-decks. use *piwip* play an instrument through line-in and then add have a midi keyboard/sequencer to play notes, in realtime. the notes will be "played" from the underlying tape by pitching up/down through speed changes relative to the known recorded pitch at each position on the tape.

future directions:

- fix bugs

### Requirements

- midi input
- audio input
- norns

### Documentation


## demo 


## my other norns scripts

- [barcode](https://github.com/schollz/barcode): replays a buffer six times, at different levels & pans & rates & positions, modulated by lfos on every parameter.
- [blndr](https://github.com/schollz/blndr): a quantized delay with time morphing
- [clcks](https://github.com/schollz/clcks): a tempo-locked repeater
- [oooooo](https://github.com/schollz/oooooo): digital tape loops
